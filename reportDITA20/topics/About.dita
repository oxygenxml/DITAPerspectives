        <p>DITA is not defined as a flat list of elements, but each element is either a base element
            or it derives as a specialized version of another element. This hierarchy should
            actually decrease the cognitive complexity of a vocabulary because it allows you to find
            an element faster than working with a flat list. </p>
        <p>In this presentation we want to show the hierarchy of elements in DITA and then explore
            how we may take advantage of this in understanding the DITA architecture, learning DITA,
            document authoring, etc.</p>
