	<title>Taking advantage of DITA elements hierarchy</title>
	<body>
		<p>Elements in DITA are defined not as a flat list of elements, but instead DITA defines a
			hierarchy, similar to a type hierarchy, and elements are either base elements or they
			are derived from another element. If we look at the analogy with a type system, the base
			elements are similar to the primitive types and the other elements are equivalent to
			derived types.</p>
		<p>This is realized using values specified in the <b>class</b> attribute. These values
			specify the category and the name of the current element and, if we talk about a derived
			element, also the name and category of its parent, as well as all the ancestors up to
			the base element.</p>
		<p>For example the <xmlatt>class</xmlatt> value for the <xmlelement>lcPlanTitle</xmlelement>
			element
			is:<codeblock outputclass="language-xml">class="- topic/fig learningBase/fig learningPlan/lcPlanTitle"</codeblock>This
			means that the current element is <xmlelement>lcPlanTitle</xmlelement> from the
			<codeph>learningPlan</codeph> category and this is derived from the
			<xmlelement>fig</xmlelement> element from the <codeph>learningBase</codeph> category,
			which in turn is defined from the <xmlelement>fig</xmlelement> element from the
			<codeph>topic</codeph> category.</p>
		<p>We may take this information into account in some situations.</p>
